    <h1>Software Developer... in training</h1>

    <p>I am currently studying to become more proficient on the <em>Software Development</em> side of the IT world, having spent a few years on the hardware/networking side of the house I'm finding that my skillset could use a little <big>expansion</big>. I would like to be able to use these skills I am learning to help gain some efficiencies and also, help to <b>fill</b> some knowledge gaps within my current environment. </p>

    <h3>Biography</h3>

    <p> I am originally from Los Angeles, California but moved to Wisconsin when I was 22 years old. I am the father to 5 girls from 8 to 22 years old, and I also have two dogs and a brand new kitten. I have only been in IT for about 5 years, I chose that career after being medically retired from the Army where I served as an Infantryman/Cavalry Scout. I think I was interested in IT because I always <del> tore everything apart</del> wondered how things worked since I was kid. <mark>I am still that kid.</mark> I am currently a user support specialist with Rock County, State of Wisconsin. I enjoy my current position but there are some others I would be interested in that pay more money, 5 daughters cost <i>a lot</i> of it! </p>
